### Want to know more about me?

I started learning to code in 🗓️ January 2022, when I made the decision to leave behind my career as a 👩‍🏫 teacher. I used to teach my young students coding skills with tools like Code.org and Scratch, and one day asked myself, "Why should they have all the fun?"

Fast forward to my first 🌍 "Hello World" and enrollment in a 👩‍💻 software engineering bootcamp with [Springboard](https://www.springboard.com). It's been an incredible 🧠 learning journey so far, and I'm excited for what lies ahead in my new career.

I love solving problems and collaborating with others, and am 🤗 grateful for the opportunity I had to work on a team as a member of [The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes/). You can find our team project with my contributions [here](https://github.com/the-collab-lab/tcl-47-smart-shopping-list).

I'm always learning something new; these are the skills and tools I'm most experienced with so far:
